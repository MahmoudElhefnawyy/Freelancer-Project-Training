# Employee Management System (EMS) - MERN Stack

A comprehensive Employee Management System built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This full-stack web application streamlines HR processes, enabling efficient management of employee data, attendance, leave requests, projects, and more. It includes role-based access for employees and HR/admin, secure authentication, and a responsive user interface.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete employee records with details like name, email, position, department, salary, and joining date.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with role-based access (Employee, HR/Admin).
- **Employee Dashboard**: Employees can view their profile, attendance, leave history, payslips, and assigned projects.
- **HR/Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage employee records, approve/reject leave requests, issue notices, and oversee project assignments.
- **Leave Management**: Employees can apply for leaves; admins can view, approve, or reject leave requests.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Employees can mark daily attendance; admins can monitor attendance records.
- **Project Management**: Admins can create, update, and assign projects to employees; employees can view their project details.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Notify users of updates (e.g., leave approvals, profile changes, or new notices).
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles, including uploading profile pictures.
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and analytics for HR to monitor attendance, leave trends, and employee performance using Chart.js.

### Additional Features
